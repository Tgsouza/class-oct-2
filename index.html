        <h1>Halloween: A Spooky Tradition Full of History and Fun</h1>
        <p>Halloween, celebrated on October 31st, is a time when spooky spirits, carved pumpkins, and candy take center stage. Its origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, a time when people believed that the boundary between the living and the dead became blurred, allowing ghosts to walk the earth. To ward off these spirits, the Celts lit bonfires and wore costumes, a tradition that has evolved into the Halloween we know today.</p>

        <p>In the 19th century, Irish and Scottish immigrants brought Halloween to North America, where it gained popularity. Now, it's a holiday marked by activities like trick-or-treating, where children dress up in costumes and collect candy door-to-door, carving jack-o'-lanterns, and visiting haunted houses. The holiday's symbolism of witches, ghosts, and monsters makes it an exciting, slightly eerie celebration for people of all ages.</p>
